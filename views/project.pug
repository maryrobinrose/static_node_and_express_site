/*
Complete your Pug files
-->>Go through each of the four Pug templates to inject your data. The Pug files contain comments that detail each change you will need to make. You can and should delete these comments when you are finished with this step. But you should wait to do so until everything is working as it should, in case you need to refer to these notes during development.
-->>Leave the example HTML files in your project so your reviewer can reference them.
-->>Note: Consider adding a target attribute set to _blank on the a tags for the live links to your projects so that they open in a new window.
